## 📌 Overview
This project was completed as part of the **Industry Sprint**, focused on helping **Wealthsimple**, a rapidly growing Canadian fintech serving over **3 million customers**, understand how to differentiate itself from traditional financial institutions.

## 🔍 Key Findings

### **1. Cheque Deposit Holds**
- The largest issue in deposits/withdrawals  
- **23% of complaints** relate to cheque deposit holds  
- Customers frequently lose access to critical income (rent, bills, emergencies)

**Opportunities**
- Use a **risk-scoring model** to shorten hold times for low-risk, long-tenured accounts  
- Provide **real-time app or SMS updates** explaining hold status and expected release time

**Opportunities**
Provide real-time transfer visibility within the app:
1. Why a transfer failed  
2. What is causing a delay  
3. When funds will be available  
4. Whether customer action is required  

---

### **3. Customer Service**
- The dataset underrepresents service-related complaints due to structural limitations  
- Many issues originate from poor communication or lack of clear guidance

**Opportunity**
- Treat **every issue as a customer service issue first**
